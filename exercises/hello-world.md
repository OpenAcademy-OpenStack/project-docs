# Hello World

1. Get familiarized with Cloud principles. Let us use AWS EC2 as the first
example. If you're already familiar with EC2 and have built apps on cloud,
then move on to Step 2.
    a. Go to http://aws.amazon.com/free/, create an account,
    and try how EC2 works via the online console. EC2 is the compute platform on AWS.
    b. Then spend some time with EC2 documentation
    http://aws.amazon.com/documentation/ec2/. Don't worry about too many
    details. Our main goal here is to get familiarized with how you can
    provision infrastructure components like Virtual Machines, Block Storage,
     Floating IPs etc using APIs.
    c. Create a VM, login, and setup a web server just to learn the pieces involved.
    d. Once done, delete the VM from the console.
2. Familiarize yourself with OpenStack. OpenStack is an open-source software
for  setting up cloud. Watch videos like
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCsw2kkIWyw and
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWWSaBOMTNo for a jump start.
3. We're assuming that you are already familiar with Python,
and have a development environment with Python 2.7. It is really important to
 be able to program in Python for this project.
4. Then follow the steps at
https://gist.github.com/s3u/7348242#what-should-i-start-working-on to setup
DevStack (http://devstack.org/). DevStack is cloud in a box. Once DevStack is
 up and running, you will notice that DevStack starts a number of services.
